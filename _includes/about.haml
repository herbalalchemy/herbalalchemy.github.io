  I've been making herbal smoking blends since I began studying herbalism in 2009. Over that time I've experimented with many different plants and recipes and learned what works together and in what proportions - and what doesn't. These smoking blends represent long years of attempts to find a tobacco substitute that makes smoking enjoyable without the harshness and unpleasant odor of tobacco.
